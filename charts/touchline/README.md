# touchline

Helm chart for the in-cluster half of the Touchline Times demo: the 5 in-app AI agents
(orchestrator, news, odds, editorial, compliance), the site backend, a Redis cache, a
site-traffic load generator, a scheduled experiments job, an optional synthetic-browser CronJob,
and an in-namespace Grafana Alloy collector that receives their OTLP and forwards it to Grafana
Cloud.

Not included, by design: the Claude apps gateway, its Postgres, and Private Data Source Connect.
Those run on the EC2 agent host built by `terraform/` and `agent-host/` (see the repo README and
`docs/coding-agents.md`), because the gateway and the developer containers need a machine outside
the cluster's Kubernetes RBAC boundary.

This chart never creates a Kubernetes `Secret`. It reads existing ones that Terraform already
created, by name, via `secrets.grafanaOtlp` / `secrets.agento11y` / `secrets.faro` (and
`secrets.experiments`, which the experiments job needs for its score reads).

## Installing

Terraform installs this chart for you (`deploy_workloads = true`, the default). To install or
render it yourself:

```console
helm dependency build charts/touchline   # no-op today; see "Alloy" below
helm lint charts/touchline -f charts/touchline/ci/test-values.yaml
helm template touchline charts/touchline -f charts/touchline/ci/test-values.yaml
helm install touchline charts/touchline -n touchline --create-namespace -f my-values.yaml
```

`charts/touchline/ci/test-values.yaml` has realistic fake values (fabricated ARNs, a fake AWS
account id) safe to use for `lint`/`template`. It is not meant for a real install: the real
`modelProfileArn` values and secret contents come from the Terraform module (`terraform/`), which
renders them into a values file for `deploy_workloads = false` consumers, or supplies them
directly to `helm_release` when it installs the chart itself.

## Alloy

The chart owns a plain `Deployment` + `ConfigMap` running `grafana/alloy` directly (`alloy.yaml`),
not the upstream `grafana/alloy` Helm chart as a dependency. The plain Deployment is simpler,
needs no network access to run `helm lint`/`helm template` in CI, and lets the chart's own
templates inject the Grafana Cloud OTLP secret name and Kubernetes RBAC directly instead of
fighting Helm's static (non-templated) subchart values. `helm dependency build` is safe to run
(the `just setup` recipe always runs it) but is a no-op here since `Chart.yaml` declares no
dependencies.

The collector receives OTLP on `4317` (gRPC) / `4318` (HTTP) from every app in the namespace,
adds Kubernetes resource attributes (`k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.pod.name`, `k8s.node.name`,
`k8s.deployment.name`) with the `k8sattributes` processor keyed off the sending pod's connection
IP, batches, and forwards metrics/logs/traces to the `secrets.grafanaOtlp` endpoint over basic
auth. The `k8sattributes` `filter.namespace` block restricts it to watching `.Values.namespace`
only, so it runs on a namespaced `Role` (`get`/`list`/`watch` on `pods` and `replicasets`, no
`ClusterRole` and no read of `namespaces`) - see the comment in `alloy.yaml`. The receiver itself
has no authentication, so a `NetworkPolicy` restricts ingress on `4317`/`4318` to pods in the
same namespace; it runs as the upstream image's non-root `alloy` user (uid `473`).

The `NetworkPolicy` only takes effect on a cluster that enforces network policy; elsewhere it is
accepted and silently ignored, and any pod in the cluster can send telemetry to the collector.
On EKS, enforcement is **off by default in both modes**. With the VPC CNI add-on, enable its
network policy agent (`enableNetworkPolicy: "true"` in the add-on configuration). On EKS Auto
Mode, network policy is built in but the controller still has to be switched on, by applying a
`ConfigMap` named `amazon-vpc-cni` in `kube-system` with
`enable-network-policy-controller: "true"`
([AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/auto-net-pol.html)). The
`examples/eks-auto-mode` cluster does not apply that ConfigMap for you.

Set `alloy.enabled: false` to skip it if you already run a cluster-wide collector; in that case
point every app's OTLP endpoint at your own collector yourself (not currently exposed as a chart
value - ask for it if you need it).

### Pod log tailing

The apps write structured JSON log lines to stdout (`{"event":"generation", ...}`) that the
dashboards query directly in Loki (`| json | event="generation"`); that data never goes over
OTLP. The same Alloy also tails every pod's stdout in `.Values.namespace` through the Kubernetes
API (`discovery.kubernetes` + `loki.source.kubernetes`, no privileged container, no DaemonSet, no
node filesystem access) and feeds it into the same `otelcol.processor.batch` and
`otelcol.exporter.otlphttp` the OTLP path uses, so it reaches Grafana Cloud with the same
credentials. `discovery.kubernetes`'s `namespaces.names` keeps this namespace-scoped like the
`k8sattributes` processor above, and a `discovery.relabel` `keep` rule on the
`app.kubernetes.io/name` pod label (which every Deployment/CronJob here sets) is a second layer
of defence against tailing anything a consumer might install into the same namespace.

`otelcol.receiver.loki` puts every Loki label on a tailed entry onto the log record as an
attribute of the same name, not onto the resource. An `otelcol.processor.transform` (OTTL) step in
log context copies them onto the resource under the dotted keys Grafana Cloud's OTLP endpoint
promotes to Loki index labels, then drops the record copies: `service_name` -> `service.name`,
`service_namespace` -> `service.namespace` (matching `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` and the
`service.namespace` every app already sets), `namespace` -> `k8s.namespace.name`, `pod` ->
`k8s.pod.name`, `container` -> `k8s.container.name`. Without that step the stream lands as
`service_name="unknown_service"`. The same step sets the record's trace and span IDs from the
`trace_id`/`span_id` fields in the JSON line, so trace-to-logs works.

The config lives in `templates/_alloy-config.tpl`, and its hash is a pod annotation on the
Deployment: Alloy does not watch its config file, so a config change restarts the pod.

The RBAC is the same `Role` as the `k8sattributes` processor above plus a `get` rule on
`pods/log` (the kubelet log endpoint, a separate subresource from `pods`). It is still
namespaced, with no `ClusterRole`.

A container that exposes more than one port is discovered once per port by `discovery.kubernetes`
and so is tailed more than once; only this chart's own Alloy container (ports `4317`/`4318`) hits
this, and the only effect is a few duplicate lines in Alloy's own operational logs, which nothing
here dashboards against.

## Shared image, different command

The 5 agent Deployments, the load generator and the experiments `CronJob` all run
`images.registry/images.namePrefix` + `agents:images.tag`. The load generator keeps the image's
entrypoint and sets `ROLE=loadgen`, and the experiments job overrides
`command: ["node", "experiments/run-experiment.mjs"]` with `args`, running the same agents image
in three roles from one image. The images carry no npm CLI, so a
container command must call `node` directly (`just lint` rejects `npm` and `npx`).
`images.registry/images.namePrefix` + `site:images.tag` is the site backend;
`images.registry/images.namePrefix` + `site-browser:images.tag` (the `Dockerfile.browser` image,
run by the optional `siteBrowser` CronJob) is a third, separate image built from the same
`apps/site` package.

## Experiments RBAC

The experiments `CronJob` takes a `coordination.k8s.io` Lease (`<nameOverride>-experiments`,
see `apps/agents/experiments/lease.mjs`) so overlapping scheduled Jobs never double-create runs.
It runs as its own ServiceAccount, `serviceAccounts.experiments` (no AWS access), bound to a
namespaced `Role`/`RoleBinding` granting `create` on Leases (unscoped: the object does not exist
yet, so a resourceNames filter is not possible on `create`) plus `get`/`update`/`patch` scoped by
`resourceNames` to that one Lease.

## Traffic switch

`traffic.enabled: false` scales the load generator `Deployment` to 0 replicas and suspends the
experiments and site-browser `CronJob`s. Nothing is removed, so flipping it back to `true` needs
no other change. It does not touch the agents, site or Alloy, and it has no effect
on the agent-host's own developer traffic (a separate switch, `agent-host/`).

## Values

Keys marked Frozen are the ones the Terraform module sets; `values.schema.json` checks their shape.

| `serviceAccounts.agents` | string | `touchline-agents` | ServiceAccount for the 5 agents only. Bound to the Bedrock IAM role by EKS Pod Identity (by name; no annotation). Frozen. |
| `serviceAccounts.loadgen` | string | `touchline-loadgen` | ServiceAccount for the load generator. No AWS access, no Kubernetes API access. Frozen. |
| `serviceAccounts.experiments` | string | `touchline-experiments` | ServiceAccount for the experiments CronJob. No AWS access; bound to the Lease Role instead (see "Experiments RBAC"). Frozen. |
| `serviceAccounts.site` | string | `touchline-site` | ServiceAccount for the site. No AWS access. Frozen. |
| `secrets.grafanaOtlp` | string | `touchline-grafana-otlp` | Existing Secret (keys `endpoint`, `username`, `password`) Alloy uses to forward to Grafana Cloud. Frozen. |
| `secrets.agento11y` | string | `touchline-agento11y` | Existing Secret (keys `endpoint`, `tenant_id`, `token`) for the Agent Observability SDK. Frozen. |
| `secrets.faro` | string | `touchline-faro` | Existing Secret (key `collector_url`, may be absent/empty) for frontend observability. Frozen. |
| `secrets.experiments` | string | `""` | Existing Secret (keys `grafana_url`, `token`) for the experiments job's control-plane calls (`AGENTO11Y_GRAFANA_URL`/`AGENTO11Y_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`): publishing the stored test suite, and every read the ingest token is refused, including evaluator scores. Terraform always sets it. Empty omits both env vars, and runs then fail at their first score read. |
| `aws.region` | string | `eu-west-1` | Region passed to the agents as `AWS_REGION`. Frozen. |
| `agentVersion` | string | `v1` | `AGENT_VERSION` on every agent, the load generator and the experiments job. Must be identical on the orchestrator and the experiments job: the runner computes each prompt variant's version independently in both processes and compares them. |
| `agents.<role>.modelProfileArn` | string | `""` | Bedrock application inference profile ARN for that agent (`MODEL_PROFILE_ARN`). Frozen key shape (`agents` map, `modelProfileArn`/`team` fields). |
| `agents.<role>.modelKey` | string | see `values.yaml` | `MODEL_KEY`: the `bedrock_models` key for this agent's default profile (e.g. `haiku`). |
| `agents.<role>.modelName` | string | `""` | `MODEL_NAME`: a Bedrock model or inference profile id (e.g. `eu.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`), normalised by the app to the canonical Claude model name for the recorded `gen_ai` model. |
| `agents.orchestrator.modelProfiles` | object | `{}` | Extra `{key: {arn, name}}` profiles rendered as `MODEL_PROFILES` (compact JSON), enabling the orchestrator's per-request `x-agent-model` routing used by the model-comparison experiments. Only meaningful on `orchestrator`. |
| `agents.<role>.team` | string | see `values.yaml` | Owning team, carried through as `AGENT_TEAM` and a label. |
| `agentResources` | object | 50m/256Mi request, 512Mi limit | Resource requests/limits shared by all 5 agent Deployments. |
| `contentCapture` | bool | `true` | Sets `AGENTO11Y_CONTENT_CAPTURE_MODE` (agents/loadgen/experiments) and `CONTENT_CAPTURE` (every app, including site-browser, which has no `AGENTO11Y_*` vars since it does not use the Agent Observability SDK). Frozen. See `docs/security.md`. |
| `traffic.enabled` | bool | `true` | Master switch for the load generator, the experiments schedule and the site-browser schedule. Frozen. |
| `traffic.siteRequestsPerMinute` | number | `2` | Load generator rate, passed through a ConfigMap (`requestsPerMinute` in the rate file). Frozen. |
| `traffic.experimentsSchedule` | string | `17 * * * *` | Cron schedule for the experiments job: hourly at minute 17. The runner fires on 70% of slots, picks one suite by weight and stops at its daily cap of 12 runs. |
| `loadgen.dailyBudgetUsd` | number | `5` | Estimated Bedrock spend cap per UTC day, passed through the rate file (`dailyBudgetUsd`); the load generator itself caps this at 30 USD/day regardless. |
| `loadgen.dailyCurve` | array or `null` | `null` | 24 UTC hour-of-day multipliers (index 0 = 00:00 UTC) shaping `traffic.siteRequestsPerMinute` across the day, passed through the rate file (`dailyCurve`). `null` keeps the load generator's own built-in default curve. Only the relative shape matters: the load generator renormalises by the curve's own average, so `siteRequestsPerMinute` always stays the true daily mean. |
| `loadgen.kickoffPeaksEnabled` | bool | `true` | Extra request-rate peaks around each fixture's kick-off hour and weekday (from `apps/mcp-tools/src/data/fixtures.json`), recurring every week regardless of which week's fixture date has passed. Passed through the rate file (`kickoffPeaksEnabled`). |
| `loadgen.injection.burstMeanIntervalHours` | number | `4` | Mean hours between prompt-injection probe bursts (a few probe conversations from one reader in a short window). Passed through the rate file (`injectionBurstMeanIntervalHours`). |
| `loadgen.injection.burstMaxSize` | number | `3` | Max probe conversations sent in one burst. Passed through the rate file (`injectionBurstMaxSize`); the load generator itself caps this at 8 regardless. |
| `loadgen.persistence.enabled` | bool | `false` | Give the load generator a PVC for its spend ledger; `false` uses an `emptyDir` (state resets on restart), needed on clusters with no default StorageClass. |
| `loadgen.persistence.size` | string | `1Gi` | PVC size. |
| `loadgen.persistence.storageClassName` | string | `""` | Empty uses the cluster's default StorageClass. |
| `loadgen.resources` | object | 25m/128Mi request, 256Mi limit | Load generator resources. |
| `siteBrowser.enabled` | bool | `true` | Run the synthetic headless-browser reader CronJob (`site-browser` image), one real Chromium page load per run so Frontend Observability gets page loads, web vitals and browser-to-backend traces with no human visitor. |
| `siteBrowser.schedule` | string | `*/10 * * * *` | Cron schedule for the site-browser job. Suspended (not removed) when `traffic.enabled` is `false`. |
| `siteBrowser.resources` | object | 100m/256Mi request, 512Mi limit | Site-browser job resources. |
| `experiments.variantIds` | string | `brief,balanced,contextual` | `--variant-ids` passed to the scheduled experiment run. |
| `experiments.resources` | object | 50m/128Mi request, 512Mi limit | Experiments job resources. |
| `site.ingress` | object/null | `null` | `null` keeps the site ClusterIP-only. Set `{ className, host, annotations }` to expose it. Frozen key (`site.ingress`). |
| `site.resources` | object | 50m/128Mi request, 512Mi limit | Site resources. |
| `redis.image.repository` / `.tag` | string | `redis` / `7.4.6` | Redis image. No persistence: it only caches synthetic demo traffic state. |
| `redis.resources` | object | 25m/64Mi request, 128Mi limit | Redis resources. |
| `alloy.enabled` | bool | `true` | Run the in-namespace collector. |
| `alloy.resources` | object | 100m/256Mi request, 512Mi limit | Alloy resources. |
